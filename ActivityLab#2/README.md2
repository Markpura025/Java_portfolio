The code have two classes:
- Book: Represents a book with attributes like title, author, year published, and current page.
- MyBookList: Manages an array of Book objects, performs operations such as displaying book details, updating pages, changing authors, and filtering books based on the year published.

because of that we can demonstrate on object-oriented programming concepts such as class design, object creation, array manipulation, and method usage.
